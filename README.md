# TreeInventory
TreeInventory uses an agent that launches an inventory on client computers, a management server centralizes the results of inventories. The Web Console allows you to view these inventory results, the detected network hardware, and allows you to execute allowed commands. Communications between agents and the management server are performed using the HTTP and HTTPS protocols


This is research work in progress project based on some of the inventory software available in the market.
